This is pretty straightforward. Now that I have graduated from college, I will (hopefully) regularly contribute whatever I'm doing with respect to technology, programming, learning, or any interesting things I find.
My first two little **to-dos** are get a decent, professional looking resume up on here, and document my current project: a CUDA accelerated Raytracer.

Until next time...
